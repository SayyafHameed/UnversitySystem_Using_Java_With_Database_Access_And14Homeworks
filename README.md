# University Management System

Developed a comprehensive university administration system using Java and an Access database to streamline various administrative tasks for a large educational institution.
The application encompasses modules for student enrollment, course management, faculty information, and financial records, enabling seamless data management and efficient decision-making.

# Key Features

Student Enrollment and Management: Facilitated easy registration, course assignment, and record maintenance.
Course Management: Enabled administrators to efficiently manage course offerings, scheduling, and assignments.
Faculty Management: Simplified the process of faculty assignment, tracking, and performance monitoring.
Database Integration: Utilized Microsoft Access for data storage, ensuring reliability and scalability in handling university records.
User Authentication: Implemented a secure login system to protect sensitive information and ensure authorized access.

# Technical Details

Java Programming: The primary programming language used for developing the application's core functionalities and user interfaces, focusing on object-oriented design principles.
Access Database: The relational database management system (RDBMS) used for storing and managing the university's administrative data.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): The API used for seamless communication between the Java application and the Access database, enabling data retrieval, manipulation, and storage.
User Interface (UI) Design: Created an intuitive and accessible interface to improve user experience.

- Throughout this project, I focused on writing clean, maintainable code and employing best practices in software development. This experience not only honed my programming skills in Java but also deepened my understanding of database management and system design, preparing me to tackle complex challenges in the real world.
